# Intellignet drone delivery system - Artificial Intillegence course project  
- - -
This GUI project simulates a model of a delivery drone system which creates and trains a perceptron model on a set of data to classify cities into safe or not which affects total cost of route of the drone, along with optimization of routes between cities based on simulated annealing technique.  
Built using Java and JavaFX
